After accepting full authority over all corporate information, communication and security
systems, my primary responsibilities included: Employee management, cost control, developing and directing the implementation of all IT related
projects, while assuring that my team and I consistently maintained the systems and services that our customers and employees relied on. 
My
efforts in this position resulted in a 60% increase in employee productivity and the development of the first Private Label Auction site, for one of
our key clients, creating the first source of income from the ICS Department. 
Spending in the ICS Department was decreased by more than
$100,000. I was hired into this position as the direct assistant to the Vice President over the ICS (Information and Communication Services)
Department. 
My duties included: Project management, documentation of policies and procedures, and reporting on the overall status of the ICS
Department. 
During this year, I built the first comprehensive ICS procedure manual as well as the creation or replacement of all corporate IT and
communication related policies.
