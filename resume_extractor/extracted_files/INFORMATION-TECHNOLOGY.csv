I believe that each child has their own potential and interests and curiosity in learning.
Designing an organized classroom setup, positive and welcoming, caring and secured, safe-risk taking, theme based, and discussions on
their interests during class meetings would create warm atmosphere and environment to grow in every domain of development socially,
emotionally, physically, and intellectually.
I believe the teacher needs to be a supportive person as well as a guide in providing the information, and plans for hands on activities with
tools and materials that help them for self-discovery and understand the lesson in curriculum.
Letting kids be kids and have freedom to express their own thoughts and creativity and valuing them.
My personal goal for my future classroom is to grow their potential and interests in their own pace without pressurizing with targets.
Students should be given information on where to find the answers and given the opportunity to explore the solution rather than giving the
direct answers, this gives the space for exploration and creativity.
I would have the strong idea on having the curriculum inclusive of each child's needs and interests.
Curriculum plan involving group "," course and
be the part of the little bud's life.
