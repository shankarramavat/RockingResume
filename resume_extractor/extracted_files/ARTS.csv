During my four years of high school I struggle a lot to manage my grades and make sure that I would be on the right path to achieve my goals but
some how I would always let something get in the way of my goal. Until one day my counselor and my favorite teacher came to me with help. They
helped me plan out everything that I wanted to accomplish before I graduated, with the right push and motivation I was able to achieve my goal. I
managed to get all A's, B's and C's.
