Worked directly with the UAVs to take accurate measurements in order to model it.
Designed accurate aerodynamic models of the UAVs using the program AVL, a program for the aerodynamic and flight-dynamic analysis of
rigid aircraft of arbitrary configuration.
Modeled all lifting surfaces, control surfaces, and fuselage.
Created data and run files of mass properties corresponding with each UAV.
Executed the run files for each UAV in order to obtain a full linearization of the aerodynamic model about any flight state with specified mass
properties.
Extracted stability-axis derivatives that will be imported into the flight simulation program, FlightGear, to model the simulated plane to have

Member of the AIAA and the front line team that developed a novel cooling design system for turbine blades.
Throughout this process, computational fluid dynamic software (STARCCM) and CAD were highly implemented to simulate different
geometries inside a wind tunnel.
Pressures, temperatures, velocities among other important physical quantities were analyzed in 40 different geometries.
This project contributed with the optimization process of turbine blades and aided them to achieve higher temperature levels and efficiency.
It is not a secret in today's industry that turbine engines are able to produce extremely high inlet temperatures when they implement cooling
impingement, which allow them to cool down the system without harming the performance of the engine.
Also, it allows the engine to achieve higher efficiency levels.
Upon this experiment, a research paper was written and patented.
