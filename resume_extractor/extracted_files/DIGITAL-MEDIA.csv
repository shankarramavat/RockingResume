Started off as an Anthropology major with a minor in photography but soon found I loved my art classes just as much. Â At first glance they seem
unrelated but both deal with people and expressing the human condition. While one does it through studying actions and artifacts to better
understand different cultures and time periods, the other deals with feelings and views shown through art. They are different but together they are a
good combination for a more rounded point of view. Â
