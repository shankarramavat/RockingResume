Illustrated vehicle design and highlighted major interior and exterior dimensions of the vehicle concept.
Presented a technology plan on the above parameters.
Simulation and Analysis of 1-2 Shift Processes of a 6-speed FWD AT, University of Michigan-Dearborn, March 2017.
Established a mathematic model for the transmission-vehicle system consisting of general state variable equation, specific state variable
equation for the 1st gear, 1-2 shift process and 2nd gear operation.
Simulated the launch of the vehicle from rest in 1st gear, initiated 1-2 shift at a speed of 15 mph, and 2nd gear operation for 2 seconds with
an open torque converter and a fixed throttle position using MATLAB/Simulink.
Reduced torque overshoot by spark retarding, and careful calibration of the oncoming clutch.
Further, torque hole was reduced to maximum extent with help of spark retard.
Modelling of Vehicle cooling system, University of Michigan-Dearborn, November 2016.
Built a Simulink model of vehicle cooling system consisting of four sub models namely, engine operation, air flowrate, coolant flowrate and
heat transfer.
Determined coolant flow rate, heat rejection from the engine, and engine outlet coolant temperature for different vehicle speeds by executing
the simulation model.
Computational Analysis of Hemispherical Radiating Fin, Visvesvaraya Technological University, April 2015.
Derived heat transfer equations by using two-dimensional conduction equation in spherical coordinates and subjected the same to radiative
boundary condition, with constant base temperature.
Solved derived equations using Finite Difference Method and Gauss-Seidel iterations by writing a code in FORTRAN 95.
Determined Heat transfer improvement as a function of thermal conductivity and emissivity, with and without irradiation.
The hemispherical fin starts to radiate heat for thermal conductivity > 3 (W/mK) and absorbs heat for thermal conductivity < 3="""">

Project: Develop a cavings transport model for optimizing hole-cleaning operations.
Developed a solids transport model for predicting cuttings/cavings bed height during a hole-cleaning operation.
In 
contrast to conventional CFD models that typically take several hours to run, this novel numerical model can obtain 
results within a few
minutes, enabling timely optimization of the well circulation schedule.
Investigated the competitive landscape and designed the commercialization plan for the numerical model.
